As a developer in our team, what I can contribute is that I can make the system and make it work properly similar to the design 
that was made. My most challenged opponent is myself because when something I can't do, I give up on him and it takes me a long time 
to recover. But one of the things I learned is that I should be able to manage that because we have a deadline that we are chasing and 
I don't want us to be off track in developing because I also think about the rest of my group that if I can't do it 
my colleague will be delayed.

As for my experience with my team, I've often found mistakes where I should have motivated them more, 
I think we have misunderstandings. I'm trying to tell them my problem about them to be honest, but I don't want to hurt them 
I want them to improve, we as a team must always have communication so that we can reach our goal which with mercy and help we 
reached that even though I have many mistakes, so I can say that communication is the key when it comes to doing the project.

What I want to improve in developing is my skills especially in logic, and I want to make my own project, in case 
I don't know how to start and I also want to adopt the skills that my classmate has because I admire all the developers in the room.
